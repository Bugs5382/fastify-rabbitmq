# CLAUDE.md - fastify-rabbitmq

Working agreement for this repository. It was scaffolded from `Bugs5382/project-template`;
the governance below is shared across all repos created that way.

## Enforced by hooks (run `bash .claude/hooks/install.sh` once per clone)

- Conventional Commits on commits, issue titles, and PR titles.
- No AI tells in commits/issues/PRs/comments/source; no emoji anywhere except CI workflow files.
- Pre-push: the ecosystem's format/lint/test gate must pass (Go: gofmt/vet/golangci-lint/test;
  npm: lint/test scripts; Python: ruff/pytest).

## Conventions

- Branching: never commit to `main`. Work on a feature/working branch; open a PR.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description`). The operator (@Bugs5382) is the
  author of record on every commit.
- Voice: human-authored. No attribution trailers (`Co-Authored-By`, `Generated with`), no robot
  glyphs/emoji, no session framing.
- Local design notes live in a non-tracked `plan/` folder; delete a note when its work is done.

## Workflow

Issue -> branch -> code (comments cite the issue) -> PR (closing summary, not just checked boxes)
-> close. Keep public artifacts (issues, PRs, commit messages) free of references to local-only
design notes.
